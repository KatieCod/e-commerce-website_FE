                    Trust is the medium of beauty. Clionce team has spent 4 years reserching the South Korean beauty industry
                    before launching the shop. The journey started with the most common teenage problem - acne.
                    It was a total nightmare for a young girl like me before I accidently stumbled upon
                    my very first Nature Republic anti-acne cream. It was not even intentially bought
                    but just given away as a nice present when I bought some other care products for my
                    family and friends during my very first visit to Korea. And then it happened like magic,
                    I tried it, I liked it, it worked on me. Ubelievable.
                </h5>
                <h5 className="text-center ml-4 mt-3 ml-5 mr-5">So, 4 years and 8
                    trips to South Korea later here I am confident and happy with my research. I vouch for every
                    single product I sell for that is tried and honestly evaluated by my team and I. </h5>
